# Why This Website Exists

## Spreading Value  
In the past—and even now—I have always been searching for blogs and websites that share insightful knowledge curated by **skilled craftsmen** in their respective fields. I have learned a great deal from such sources.

Personally, I prefer reading documents over watching videos or clips. When reading, information is often absorbed faster—and in greater depth.

Of course, videos with visuals and animations can make concepts easier to grasp at first glance. However, based on more than a decade of browsing experience, I can confidently say that a **well-written, credible article**, enriched with images, references, links, and GIFs, is usually far more time-efficient and effective in the long run.

I hope you will find something useful here.

## A Personal Knowledge Library  
Since developing the habit of taking notes, I initially wrote everything down in physical notebooks. Once I had my own computer, I moved to Google Docs. During my professional years, I used tools like Notion and Jira (Atlassian). Over the past three years, I have mainly been using Obsidian.

What I appreciate most about Obsidian is its document management based on `markdown` files. For a programmer, Markdown already provides nearly everything needed to write technical documentation.

All of these tools are excellent—especially Obsidian combined with Git, which is free. However, syncing with mobile devices is not always convenient, so I still use Notion and Obsidian in parallel.

That said, Obsidian sometimes feels *too powerful*—I cannot fully utilize all of its features. Notion, on the other hand, limits font customization and is not entirely free. To be honest, I am not completely satisfied with how both tools organize and retrieve information.

What I really need is just the **core functionality** of a personal knowledge library:
- Create, delete, and edit notes  
- Filter and summarize content  
- Search efficiently  
- Render basic content formats  
- Support bilingual learning  
- Sync across devices  
- Share one or multiple documents with others  

That’s it—nothing more.

I want it to be as minimal as possible 🫠. The ultimate purpose of a personal library is **speed**: when I need something, I must be able to find it instantly. Even years later, a quick glance should be enough to understand what the content is about.

That is why I decided to build this website myself. The public version is a shared space, while the private version is a bundled app tailored specifically to my personal workflow, partially synchronized with this site.

## Self-Observation and Self-Improvement  
It has been quite a long time since I have studied and worked entirely on my own.

Because I work independently, there is no one to formally evaluate the quality or effectiveness of my work. When note-taking remains purely private, laziness often overcomes discipline.

By making my thoughts and research public, I am indirectly forcing myself to take responsibility for a concrete commitment. If I fail to follow through, I feel a sense of lost credibility—and even guilt 🙃.

It is, admittedly, a rather unconventional learning method.

## Learning Rust  
When I first explored Rust two to three years ago, I was genuinely surprised—and quickly grew fond of it. I even adopted Rust-inspired design philosophies and coding conventions in my projects.

That said, Rust’s true strength does not lie solely in its philosophy, but in its **compiler**. To fully unleash Rust’s capabilities, a complete transition is necessary.

Of course, I have not yet switched to Rust 100%. At the time of writing, this website exists partly as a motivation for me to continue learning Rust =]]].

To be honest, my Rust knowledge is still limited, and many essential libraries for application and game development in Rust are not yet as mature or diverse as those in other ecosystems. Fully committing too early would be risky—wouldn’t it? 😂😂

# What Will the Articles Be About?  
The content here will be fairly diverse, as it revolves around my life. However, in the near future, most articles will focus on the knowledge I am currently learning, researching, and applying—along with some aspects of everyday life.

At the time I began building this website, I was particularly interested in:
- [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org/)  
- [Vulkan – Cross-platform 3D Graphics](https://www.vulkan.org/)  

My current technical background is primarily in `C++`, `C#`, and `Unity`. Therefore, upcoming articles will most likely revolve around three main topics:
1. Rust  
2. Vulkan  
3. C++, C#, and Unity  

Some readers might wonder: *“Wait—how is this website built? Is it written in C++?”*  
I used `React + Tailwind`. I am not deeply specialized in them—just enough to build a small static website. As such, they should not be considered my core expertise.

## Posting Frequency  
There is no fixed posting schedule, but I aim to publish at least **12 articles per year**.
