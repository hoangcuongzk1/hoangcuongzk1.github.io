# Why This Website Exists
---
Hi there — I’m Cường.  
I began my journey in Game Development back in 2021, which means it’s been nearly five years already. Throughout this time, the most valuable thing I’ve learned is the ability to **self-teach** (mostly wandering around the internet, to be honest 🫠).

For the past three years, I’ve also been working completely on my own. And frankly, those years were filled with more boredom and frustration than joy. Maybe it’s because the path I chose doesn’t quite match the majority of my peers or colleagues. In a way, it was a bit of a “foolish” choice 😂.  
But well… it is what it is.

## Reconnecting With the Community
Yup — and that’s one of the main reasons behind this website. Working alone for too long often leaves me unsure of where I stand. It feels like being a frog stuck at the bottom of a well.

So I decided to build this place, hoping that posting occasionally will help me “re-enter society” 🥲. By showing up online more, I might have more opportunities to meet and talk with new people — maybe enough to make my little well blossom a bit.

## Observing and Improving Myself
Since I work alone, there’s no one to give me feedback or evaluate the quality of what I do. When notes and documentation are kept private, laziness tends to defeat discipline.

By making my thoughts, experiments, and reflections public, I’m indirectly forcing myself to stay accountable to something concrete. Missing that responsibility means losing credibility — and dealing with a guilty conscience 🙃.

You’ll see this idea mentioned by many speakers or creators online, but in reality, it all depends on each person’s environment and circumstances.  
As for me — *the water is already up to my neck, so I guess it’s time to swim.*

## Spreading Value
In the past and even now, I constantly search for blogs and websites run by experienced developers. I’ve learned so much from those sources.

However, finding similar resources *in Vietnamese* is still pretty rare. English material is obviously abundant, but since I live and work in Vietnam, I still prefer reading from local developers. The way they write and explain things just feels easier to absorb.

And of course, we now have ChatGPT — a very convenient tool for “quick lookup.” But everything has two sides. While its usefulness is undeniable, I personally see more people becoming “jobless” in tech than before, meaning fewer colleagues and fewer peers to connect with 🙃... z z Z.



# What Will the Articles Be About?
---
I’ve read quite a number of blogs like this — from both local and international seniors. Their content is usually diverse and deeply tied to their lives.

Unfortunately, my personal life isn’t nearly as exciting. My typical day looks like: wake up → sit at my computer until evening → sleep. (And no, I’m not working 100% of that time 🙂‍↔️). Because of that, at least for now, I’ll focus solely on **game-development-related content**.  
That’s also why the website uses the sub-domain `devlog`.

Most upcoming posts will revolve around **Unity** and **C#**. I have several Unity-based projects underway anyway — two birds with one stone.

In the long run, the focus will expand beyond Unity. But that’s still far ahead, so I’ll keep that a secret for now (he he 🤣).  
And no — it won’t be Unreal or Godot.

# A “Lightweight Promise” & Closing Thoughts

## Posting Frequency  
The schedule won’t be fixed, but at the very least: **12 posts per year**.

## Notes  
Posts may be updated occasionally to improve clarity, writing flow, spelling, and the formatting of embedded files.
