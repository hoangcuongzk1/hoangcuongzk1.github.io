# Why This Website Exists
---
## Observing and Improving Myself
Working alone means there’s no one around to evaluate my workflow or give feedback on the quality of what I create. When note-taking is purely personal, laziness can easily overpower discipline.

By putting my thoughts, reflections, and research out in public, I’m giving myself a subtle form of accountability — a commitment I have to honor. Otherwise, I’d be losing credibility and battling my own conscience. *As the saying goes, “Character is what you do when no one is watching.”* (Châm ngôn dùng để diễn đạt ý tương tự.)

## Sharing Value
Both in the past and now, I constantly seek out blogs and websites run by experienced developers. I’ve learned a great deal from such sources.

I hope you’ll find something useful here as well.

# What Topics Will These Posts Cover?
---
The content will be quite diverse since it revolves around my own journey. However, in the near future, most posts will focus on what I’m currently learning, exploring, and experiencing in daily life.

Right now, as I’m building this website, I’m particularly excited about:
- [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org/)
- [Vulkan — Cross-Platform 3D Graphics](https://www.vulkan.org/)

My foundation is mostly in Unity and C#, so upcoming posts will likely revolve around these three areas.

# Posting Frequency
---
There isn’t a fixed schedule, but I’ll aim to publish at least 12 posts a year.
